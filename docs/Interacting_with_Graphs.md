# Interacting with Graphs

GraphSpace is designed to provide access to following commonly used features:

- [Searching within a graph](#search)
- [Exporting a graph](#export)
- [Changing the graph layout](#change-layout)
- [Filtering nodes and edges](#filter-nodes-and-edges)
- [Setting default layout](#default-layout)

## Search 

This feature provides a search bar that allows the user to find nodes/edges that match search terms. See [Search Query Semantics](Quick_Tour_of_GraphSpace.html) section for more information on query semantics. If one or more nodes or edges matches the query, GraphSpace generates a link above the search bar. Visting this link will display the graph with all the nodes/edges matching the search terms highlighted. The user can share this URL with other GraphSpace users who can access this graph.
