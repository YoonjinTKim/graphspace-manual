# Programmers Guide

The GraphSpace REST API provides API endpoints for GraphSpace entities like graphs, layouts and groups that allow developers to interact with the GraphSpace website remotely by sending and receiving JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. JSON is a lightweight and human-readable open standard data format. It looks like Objects in JavaScript; hence the name. When you send content to or make a request to the API, the response will be returned in JSON. This enables developers to create, read and update GraphSpace content from client-side JavaScript or from external applications, even those written in languages beyond Python.

> **Note:** In order to fully utilize the features of this RESTful API, you must have an account on GraphSpace.
